# Python-Toolbar
A toolbar for windows (tested on Linux, modified version will be added) with the ability to add buttons to applications and (not tested) other files.

## Instructions:
For the program to work please make sure that you add your file paths to program.txt and the path to the icon you want for that file in image.txt, once you have done that add increasing numbers to widget_num.txt in accordance to how many files and images you have added to the other files.  If you don't do the last one the buttons will not be added.

## In the future:
As of 14/05/2021, I am currently working on another program to easily add more items to program.txt, image.txt and widget_num.txt.  I don't know how long this may take but will upload the first working version as soon as it's ready.  I will also work on adding more features along with the customizations program such as small games, a clock and opening specific webpages.

## Bugs:
If you notice any bugs or need assistance with the program, please email me at: ThisIsForReasons@gmail.com.  I'll do my best to respond quickly and helpfully.
